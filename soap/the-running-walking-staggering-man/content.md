# Joe Mbu - The Running Walking Staggering Man

Yesterday an old buddy of mine set off on a great adventure to run the length of the UK, [from Land's End to John O'Groats](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Land's+End,+Sennen,+Cornwall&daddr=John+o'+Groats&hl=en&ll=54.059388,1.142578&spn=14.915163,46.362305&sll=52.8382,-2.327815&sspn=7.660759,23.181152&geocode=FZ_X-wId6Oao_ylHcBAwN7hqSDHsbLNvvEQotA%3BFfO7fgMddy3R_ynDUr64It-aSDF0xbX1N9v4hg&oq=john+o&t=h&mra=ls&z=5 "A long long way to run"), in order to raise much-needed funds for Joedy Memorial Hospital and raise awareness about Nigeria’s healthcare problems.

This epic journey, which will see Joe run 1200 miles on a winding route up the UK, is already raising funds for Joedy Memorial Hospital even though Joe only started his run yesterday, on the 29th March.  Joe will complete this feat of running (and walking, and staggering) in just over a month and half!

To make this even more incredible, Joe is not a natural long distance runner!  This really will be a test of willpower so even if you can’t make a [donation](http://www.234give.com/cause/joedy-memorial-hospital) to Joedy give him a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RunWalkStagger) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/joseph.mbu) because he’ll appreciate the support!

### Joedy Memorial Hospital

Joedy was set up in 1998 by Joe’s grandparents to serve people in the Boki local government area and part of the funding raised from Joe’s run will go towards granting a special access fund to the local indigenous natives in the area who have extremely limited access to medical facilities.

The funding will also go towards renovation, staffing and new equipment.  If you can help then please consider making a [donation](http://www.234give.com/cause/joedy-memorial-hospital).

### Good Luck Joe
