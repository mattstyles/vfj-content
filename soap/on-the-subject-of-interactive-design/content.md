# On the subject of interactive design

Interaction design, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design "Interaction Design | Wikipedia) (amongst others) is “about shaping digital things for people’s use”, or, “the practise of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems and services”.  Surely this definition is even more prevalent today to the discipline of designing products for the web than it ever has been?

In contrast to the product of designing interactive elements the outcome of designing for print is a far more passive affair for the consumer and it is an art that has developed incredibly adept solutions for breaking the passivity and engaging the consumer.  Part of the AIGA definition of [Graphic Design](http://www.aiga.org/guide-whatisgraphicdesign/ "What is Graphic Design | AIGA) states that:

> graphic designers learn how to construct a message and how to present it successfully
> Definition of Graphic Design — AIGA

It is the presentation that is purposeful in Graphic Design, using images, type and symbology as primary mediums to present information and engage consumers of the content.  Each of these disciplines is a great work of study in and of itself and together are a powerful combination in the hands of the right designer.

They are also the primary tools of early internet design and are still prevalent in many aspects of the web today—and so they should be—but with each passing day a new method technology is released on to the web and it is a startling pace that the development of the web is currently undergoing. 

As designers and developers we must continue to embrace the one genuine strength that the web has over the long-established print medium—_interactivity_.

## A Change In Skills

I was very lucky to attend an excellent conference a few weeks ago with some of the best designers and developers talking about responsive design.  _Responsive Web Design_ has been a topic of discussion for quite a while and it is amazing that some companies or designers have not embraced it fully and learnt to implement it in their work flow.

Mark Boulton writes about [The In-Between](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/theinbetween "The In-Between | Mark Boulton) and mentions various aspects of how he and his team approach designing for multiple size conditions, and he also mentions the speed at which the web is developing and how exciting this time is for anyone creating _things_ to go on the web.  Elliot Jay Stocks also mentions how not everyone has yet embraced [Responsive Web Design](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/responsive-web-design-the-war-has-not-yet-been-won/ "Responsive Web Design | Elliot Jay Stocks) and, of course, [Ethan Marcotte](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design "Responsive Web Design | "Ethan Marcotte") (amongst others) has long extolled the benefits of leaving fixed widths behind.

But to design for a responsive web (or, an _interactive_ web) requires a change in skill-set for many designers, especially those well-versed in Graphic Design and Designing for Print.

Designing for the web is a different skill—and it is fast becoming ever more divergent.

That is not to say that there are not similarities and that all of the many lessons learned from designing for print over the last few hundred years have suddenly not got a place—far from it!  The web is still, currently, primarily a source of written information and whilst our level of interaction with the web is currently fairly vast there will be a long way to go before it’s primary means of communication is not written.

### Coding and Designing

It was with sadness that I heard speakers at the conference state that they, as designers, could not code for the web and with even more sadness that some of those speakers did not seem to value possessing such a skill (thankfully, other speakers—also designers—did not share this view).  Without such a skill a designer must also rely on others to implement their ideas and then iterate their design based on feedback from that experience.  Not only is this way of working inefficient it means that design is, in effect, a static effort (or, more accurately, a _series_ of static efforts) and designing for interactivity is difficult (to say the least) from a static vantage point.

## Bridging The Gap

### Where Design Meets Development

Responsivity is only one area of designing for the web that becomes very much more time-consuming and difficult when working from static images of design-work.  Designing for user stories becomes a series of static images, clearly a working representation of that flow is more beneficial both for the designer and for the client who has commissioned the effort.  It is embracing this dynamic workflow that is becoming increasingly important for designers.

There is still a place for carefully constructed PSDs and wireframes that encompass all of the _traditional_ design skills but why not remove the imaginative gap that clients must perform to sign-off on static designs of interactive elements?  Why not give them an HTML document as a deliverable?  Why deliver a PSD of the different buttons and sliders (or flow) you see as part of their designs when you can deliver working versions of these elements with just a basic understanding of CSS and HTML?

I’m not suggesting that designers need to become top-class coders or that developers need to understand all of the nuances of the design world but a grasp of the basics of either discipline produces better products and that is surely the most important thing.

Being able to design in the browser, and design early in the browser, has the advantage of fully embracing the interactive elements so that their operation and the experience of operating them is a key part of the life of the product, rather than candy at the end.  Consideration of the interactive elements of the web site or web app you are developing should be right up there with early considerations such as layout, flow and typography.

_Embrace designing in the browser, embrace interactivity—bake it into your workflow._  

Learn these skills early and learn them well.  The web is increasingly growing more and more interactive and products need to reflect this from their conception.

There has always been, and always will be, a need for those experts of design and those experts of development but there is a growing clamour for web-folk that can successfully do both.  By all means specialise in the discipline that suits you most but be aware of the other, the days of those who are only skilled in one discipline are rapidly coming to an end.
