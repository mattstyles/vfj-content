# Moving On

So, this is it, the end of a road. I wrote this blogging platform many many years ago when I had very little clue what I was doing and it is time to admit that it is time to move on from it.

Yet, I feel a tug of nostalgia.

This blog was probably the first thing that I wrote from conception to deployment totally alone, this is my thing. I made the decisions alone about how it would work. I decided my requirements and built the system to just meet those needs and it still serves those requirements better than 99% of other blogging platforms out there.

It’s fairly easy to write anything; there is no editor! Write in markdown, but write whatever you like using whatever editor you want. The platform (its called Viperfish, by the way) just needs the markdown file put in a specific folder with a few bits of meta et voila, post published.

It’s versioned using github and the content is hosted in the public repo. I then point Viperfish to that content repo and it fetches, caches and serves that content based on URL. Simple, but effective.

_However…_

I never hacked up a preview area.

I never hooked up automatically creating the meta connected to new posts, and I always cock up creating it first time round, plus, its bloody annoying.

It doesn’t help eyeballs getting to the content.

So…putting up with the pang of nostalgia it is time to find a proper writing platform. One that is simple and clean to use, one that is easy to deploy, easy to edit and, most importantly, easy to read.

_And I think I may have found it…_
