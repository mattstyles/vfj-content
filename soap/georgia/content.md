# Georgia

![Georgia - Sepia Toned](img/georgiaSepiaCut.jpg "Georgia, aged 19 mths and 10 days")

Taken with my Canon 650d and 18-55mm kit lens.  Post-processing via Lightroom and Photoshop.

_update 28.03.13_: I’m proud to say that this quick, humble photo has been on a bit of a print run of late and now adorns (or is adorned by) 5 separate frames (and they aren’t all in my house!)
