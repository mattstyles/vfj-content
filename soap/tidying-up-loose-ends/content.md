# Tying up loose ends

So lately I’ve been thinking a lot about tying up all the loose ends that are fractured all over stuff that I’m doing.  It wasn’t until I started clearing them all up that I realised what a pain (and a burden) they were becoming.

I also realised that it is time that I admitted something:

> I’m a secret hoarder

Ok, there it is.  Isn’t that supposed to be the first step?

Well it’s done now and I’ve said it.  I’ve said it out in the open for everyone to see and ridicule.  It’s bold, I know, but that’s how I roll.

So my hoarding is not as much of a problem as it is for [some people](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-22487597) but it was still a weight that I feel much better without.

My main outlet for hoarding was e-mail.  Yes, _I know_, hardly the world‘s worst crime.

Like many people I have a couple of e-mail addresses and they each serve a slightly different purpose but I have an old one that has emails in it stretching back to 2002.  It receives a hell of a lot of junk and spam, it has been hacked several times  and is generally an unloved service.

Every so often I go through and hit _select all_ and _delete_ but I have to do it page by page and it only allows 30 emails per page.  I normally get through deleting 300 or so in one go but it was like climbing a mountain as the next time I went on an email cull it would of accrued over 500.

I think there was always a secret part of me that actually found the _culling_ difficult, hence why I couldn’t stand more than a couple of minutes of it.  I knew the time was coming and so last week I sat there and spent 10 or 20 minutes deleting thousands and thousands of emails.  It was a struggle not to read them or try and categorise and store them but fight on I did and reached  inbox zero (well, I say inbox zero, the emails I did manage to categorise still sit in their categories but at least the 0 unread messages looks good).

My other email addresses were significantly better cared for and took far less time to sort out.

I have taken more drastic steps too.  [Mailbox App](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) now means that with a casual flick or slide I can whip my emails into shape, all from my phone so that I don’t let things clutter up before getting to my Mac to sort them out.

Facebook and Twitter have taken a battering too.  First it was getting rid of the real rubbish, then it was anybody who posted crap or is a _social spammer_.  Anyone who forwarded one of those dreadful _click if you like puppies_ chainies got the axe, even if I liked them in real-life, they gotta go.

My Facebook feed is still pretty terrible but at least I can keep up with people I actually like reading about a bit better now, particularly looking at pictures.  My Twitter feed was always pretty good as I actually pay some attention to following people that I’m actually interested in and the scope is pretty small so it’s a lot of people talking about similar stuff—twitter is much easier to keep track of anyway.

### Addicted to cleansing

Ok, so addicted to cleansing is slightly dramatic and over-the-top but I’ve now got the bug.

My hard drive has had a good cleanse, any apps on my phone that haven’t been opened for a few months have gone, 80% of the contents of my garage will soon be on ebay and all the parking tickets, wrappers and general detritus has been ejected from my car.

If you’d asked me before starting all this whether I thought I’d feel better at the end of it I would of told you I was fine with all the clutter.  If you ask me that question now then I would tell you I feel so much better.

I can’t put my finger on why but I feel so better.  I feel able to organise myself and see what I want to see, rather than have to see through a dirty film.  I won’t go so far as to say the world is brighter but just tidying up has meant that I _feel_ like I have more time and more energy to fix stuff and get stuff made.

So do it, clean yourself up.

Organise your notes, delete your old emails (you don’t need them), put your old photos on an external hard drive (or 2), delete those 15-minute throw-away apps (they’ve had their 15 minutes and 69p), sell your old junk (you don’t need that old sink in your shed) and de-clutter yourself.

It won’t give your an orgasm but it may just make you feel a little better.
