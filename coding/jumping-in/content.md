# Jumping In

So, I’m going to do it. I’ve checked with Kate, she’s happy enough about it. I’m going to enter Ludum Dare this year. This is my official public announcement.

To be honest, I’m typing this with a 6 week old Dotty in my arm so she will be about 3 months when the competition starts and getting a whole 48 hrs to myself may prove impossible but that will be the only thing that stops me.

_I’m committed._

_I’m keen._

_I feel slightly crazy._

I also can not wait.
