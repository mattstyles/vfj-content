# It’s all in the eyes

<div class="large-img"> ![The Eyes Have It](img/eyes-over.jpg "Georgias Eyes") </div>

Recently I’ve got right back into processing images with Lightroom and it is simply fantastic.  I shoot in RAW so it has more power for me but the speed and ease at which you can work and the level of _adjustments_ you can make are astonishing, and, to be honest, I still have a heap to learn on how to use it (let alone how to process my photos) so I still have the excitement of learning.

One technique that I have been using recently (although I haven’t always had a great new photograph to use it on) is the __Iris Enhance Brush__.

The shot above has undergone fairly heavy processing but it isn’t the same without a quick upping of exposure and contrast to the eyes which really help them to pop.

These photos (including a different treatment of the above) have also benefitted from a little extra detail being brought forward.
